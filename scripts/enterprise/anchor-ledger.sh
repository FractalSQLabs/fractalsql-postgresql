# scripts/enterprise/anchor-ledger.sh — external anchoring for the
# enterprise decision-audit ledger (fractalsql_ledger).
#
# What this closes: fractal_ledger_verify() proves nothing in the
# MIDDLE of the chain was altered or removed (every row's entry_hash
# recomputes from its own blob/mac and matches the next row's
# prev_hash). It cannot prove nothing was TRUNCATED off the very END --
# there's nothing after the last row to notice its absence. That needs
# an anchor outside this database: a record of "the chain's tip was X
# as of this time," written somewhere the database's own admin can't
# quietly rewrite. This script produces that record; you decide where
# it lives (see the PUBLISH step below).
#
# Usage (as a cron job, one line per chain you want anchored):
#   */15 * * * * PGHOST=... PGDATABASE=... /path/to/anchor-ledger.sh 1 >> /var/log/fractalsql/anchor.log
#   */15 * * * * PGHOST=... PGDATABASE=... /path/to/anchor-ledger.sh 2 >> /var/log/fractalsql/anchor.log
#
# Argument: the ledger `kind` to anchor -- 1 = QTL (fractal_ledger_flush),
# 2 = the general decision-audit chain (fractal_audit_log). Anchor
# whichever your audit scope covers; most CISO reviews want both.
#
# Verifying an anchor later: an anchor record is only useful if you can
# re-derive it. Given an anchored (kind, id, entry_hash), confirm the
# LIVE table still has a row at that id, for that kind, with that exact
# entry_hash:
#   SELECT entry_hash = '\x<anchored hex>'::bytea
#   FROM fractalsql_ledger WHERE kind = <kind> AND id = <anchored id>;
# false or no row = the row was altered, or the chain was rewound past
# it -- either way, tampering after the anchor was taken.
