# FractalSQL: Sovereign Data Intelligence
### Sovereign, Agentic PostgreSQL

**Vector Search. In-Database Reasoning. Production-Safe Agency. All beside your data.**

FractalSQL transforms PostgreSQL from a passive data store into an active agentic
database. FractalSQL adds what traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
stops short of: reasoning over what it retrieves, and — when you enable it —
acting on the result, whether that's running a generated query or executing a
decision an agent computed, all inside the same database process.

By bringing reasoning and agency directly into the PostgreSQL backend, FractalSQL
enables **Sovereign Data Intelligence**: the ability to reason, plan, and act upon
your data with the deployment topology under your control. Run fully on-prem or in
your own containers with Ollama/vLLM for zero data egress, or point at your
organization's cloud AI accounts (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Vertex) — BAA-covered
where your compliance posture requires it — for managed-model scale. You control
the trade, not the product.

| Traditional RAG Stack | The Sovereign Way (FractalSQL) |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode Collapse**: top-K search returns near-duplicates, starving the LLM of diverse context. | **Scout Discovery**: MMR-style diverse semantic search that discovers the data's real structure. |
| **Fragmented Logic**: app pulls rows, calls LLM, handles retries, and glues answers in middleware. | **In-Database Reasoning**: reasoning and embedding happen inside the backend process itself. |
| **Passive Retrieval**: you ask a question, the DB returns rows, and you hope the LLM is correct. | **Autonomous Agency**: self-correcting SQL, loop detection, and trajectory forecasting. |

## From zero to your first agent

FractalSQL's docs follow a single linear path. Each step answers one question
and hands off to the next. You don't need to read everything; follow the path.

1. **What is this and why do I care?**: you are here. Sovereign Data Intelligence, in one page.
2. **How do I get the extension running in 60 seconds?** → [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) (Docker `compose up` or the Windows `.msi`, then your first Scout search).
3. **How do I apply this to my industry?** → [Starter Kits](docs/starter-kits.md): runnable, industry-specific SQL scripts (SOC, FinTech, MedTech, Fleet, Smart-Cities, …).
4. **How does a specific agent work and what are its inputs?** → [Agent Recipes](docs/api-agency.md): the sixteen installable agents, each as a recipe.
5. **How do I build a proprietary agent that isn't in the box?** → [Composition Guide](docs/composition-guide.md): the design patterns behind the recipes.

> New here? Step 2 is a one-command demo. Step 3 drops you into a vertical that
> looks like your problem. Step 4 is the reference you'll keep coming back to.

## 🎯 Who are you?

Depending on your role, you'll want to start in different places:

- **AI Engineer**: You want to improve RAG quality and reasoning.
  → Start with **[docs/features.md](docs/features.md)** and **[docs/reasoning-setup.md](docs/reasoning-setup.md)**.
- **DBA / Security Architect**: You care about stability, safety, and grants.
  → See the **[Safety & Governance guide](docs/text-to-sql-setup.md#secure-it-authorization-vs-correctness)**.
- **Product Developer**: You want to build agentic features quickly.
  → Run the **[Docker Demo](docs/docker-demo.md)**, then pick a **[Starter Kit](docs/starter-kits.md)**.

## 🧩 What's in the box

Four tiers of SQL-callable primitives, composable into agents with plain PL/pgSQL.

- **Discovery**: diverse, mode-collapse-free retrieval: `fractal_search` (Sniper), `fractal_search_explore` (Scout), `fractal_search_telemetry` (table-backed top-K).
- **Cognition**: in-database LLM integration: `fractal_reason` (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Vertex, Ollama), `fractal_embed`, `fractal_text_to_sql`.
- **Agency**: self-correcting routines: `fractal_search_agent`, `fractal_sql_agent`, `fractal_agent_plan_explore`, `fractal_agent_detect_loop`, plus **sixteen installable agents**: see the [Agent Recipes](docs/api-agency.md).
- **Analytics**: fractal/dimension primitives: `fractal_dimension_dfa`, `fractal_dimension_boxcount`, `fractal_optimize_portfolio`, and more.

Every primitive is an ordinary SQL function, so a domain agent is just a
`CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE plpgsql` that calls them in sequence. When you're
ready to build your own, the [Composition Guide](docs/composition-guide.md)
walks through the patterns the shipped agents use. See the
**[Agent Blueprint Gallery](demo/README.md#industry-vertical-demos)** for full
SOC, FinTech, and MedTech reference implementations.

## 🚀 Get it running

The fastest path is one command. See **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)**
for the 60-second Docker run and the native installers:

```bash
docker compose up -d   # then connect and run your first Scout search
```

Native installers (PostgreSQL 14–18): `.deb` / `.rpm` for Linux amd64/arm64,
a signed Windows `.msi`, and a self-contained tarball + `install.sh` for
macOS (arm64/x86_64). See the compatibility table below.

## 🏛️ Enterprise Tier

Everything above is Community edition and fully functional on its own.
Discovery, Cognition, and Agency don't depend on anything in this section. For regulated
environments that need to **prove, not just
claim**, what an autonomous agent decided and why, an optional drop-in
library adds a tamper-evident, hash-chained decision ledger: no rebuild, no
extension reload, activated by a single GUC. See
**[Enterprise Tier](docs/enterprise.md)** for the full mechanism, including
what the hash chain can and can't prove.
